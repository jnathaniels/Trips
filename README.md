#Trips

Java Project

This is a project in which I was tasked with creating three classes based on data from a UML diagram. 
The hypothetical situation was that I would be storing data about certain vacation trips and printing it to a console. 
Vacation.java is an abstract superclass that the subclasses AllInclusive.java and Detailed.java derive from. 
TrackVacations.java is a Driver class used to test the program.
